# This is a pretty disgusting hack that I'm not 100% sure why needs to be here.
# It seems to be that this would have been useful for the `capture_io`
# assertion that.... doesn't seem to exist? Although weirdly, deleting these
# methods and trying to use the global `puts` and `print` also doesn't work?

# Given how little these tests are actually expected to run on Windows, let's
