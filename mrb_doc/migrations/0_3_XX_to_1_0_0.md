# Migrating from 0.3.XX to 1.0.0

## Camera2D

### Camera2D.new

{Camera2D#initialize} now takes in keyword arguments and provides sane defaults.
So if you have a {Camera2D} initialized like this.

```ruby
camera = Camera2D.new(Vector2.new(0, 0), Vector2.new(0, 0), 0, 1)
```

You can now just do this.

```ruby
camera = Camera2D.new
```

But if you need to specify just one of the arguments, you can now easily do so
like this.

```ruby
camera = Camera2D.new(target: Vector2[400, 240])
```

### Camera2D.drawing

{Camera2D#drawing} has now been renamed {Camera2D#draw}, so this.

```ruby
camera = Camera2D.new(Vector2.new(0, 0), Vector2.new(0, 0), 0, 1)

camera.drawing {
  Rectangle.new(10, 10, 50, 50).draw(colour: RED)
}
```

Is now this.

```ruby
camera = Camera2D.new

camera.draw {
  Rectangle.new(10, 10, 50, 50).draw(colour: RED)
}
```

## Colour

### Colour.new

You now need to specify keyword arguments. So instead of calling
```ruby
colour = Colour.new(128, 128, 0, 255)
```

You should now call
```ruby
colour = Colour.new(red: 128, blue: 128, green: 0, alpha: 255)
```

Or you could call it this way
```ruby
colour = Colour[128, 128, 0]
```

### Constants

All the {Colour} constants have been namespaced. So instead of these
```ruby
LIGHTGRAY
GRAY
DARKGRAY
YELLOW
GOLD
ORANGE
PINK
RED
MAROON
GREEN
LIME
DARKGREEN
SKYBLUE
BLUE
DARKBLUE
PURPLE
VIOLET
DARKPURPLE
BEIGE
BROWN
DARKBROWN
WHITE
BLACK
BLANK
MAGENTA
RAYWHITE
```

You should now call these
```ruby
Colour::LIGHTGRAY
Colour::GRAY
Colour::DARKGRAY
Colour::YELLOW
Colour::GOLD
Colour::ORANGE
Colour::PINK
Colour::RED
Colour::MAROON
Colour::GREEN
Colour::LIME
Colour::DARKGREEN
Colour::SKYBLUE
Colour::BLUE
Colour::DARKBLUE
Colour::PURPLE
Colour::VIOLET
Colour::DARKPURPLE
Colour::BEIGE
Colour::BROWN
Colour::DARKBROWN
Colour::WHITE
Colour::BLACK
Colour::BLANK
Colour::MAGENTA
Colour::RAYWHITE
```

## Image

### Image.load

Instead of calling
```ruby
image = Image.load("./assets/image.png")
```

you should instead call
```ruby
image = Image.new("./assets/image.png")
```

## Vector2

### Vector2.new

You are now able to create new {Vector2} records with `[]`.

```ruby
puts Vector2.new(1, 2) == Vector2[1, 2]
# => true
```

## Font

### Font#load
Instead of calling
```ruby
font = Font.load("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)
```

you should instead call
```ruby
font = Font.new("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)
```

### Font#base_size
This has been renamed to `size`.

```ruby
font = Font.new("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)

puts font.size
# => 16
```

### Font#to_h
The `base_size` key has been renamed to `size`.

```ruby
font = Font.new("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)

p font.to_h
# => {
#      :size=>16,
#      :glyph_count=>95,
#      :glyph_padding=>4,
#      :texture=>{
#        :id=>3.0,
#        :width=>512.0,
#        :height=>512.0,
#        :mipmaps=>1.0,
#        :format=>2.0
#      }
#    }
```

### Font#draw
When drawing a font to the screen, you now no longer need to specify a {Vector2}
yourself, you can just pass `x` and `y` like this.
```ruby
font.draw("hello", x: 16, y: 42)
```

But passing `position` is still supported, so this still works.
```ruby
font.draw("hello", position: Vector2.new(16, 42))
```

### Font#to_image
The `padding` argument is now `spacing` to be more consistent and more
accurately represent what it does.
```ruby
font.to_image("hello", padding: 3)
```

becomes
```ruby
font.to_image("hello", spacing: 3)
```
