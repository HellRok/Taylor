# Migrating from 0.3.XX to 1.0.0

## Font

### Font#load
Instead of calling
```ruby
font = Font.load("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)
```

you should instead call
```ruby
font = Font.new("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)
```

### Font#base_size
This has been renamed to `size`.

```ruby
font = Font.new("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)

puts font.size
# => 16
```

### Font#to_h
The `base_size` key has been renamed to `size`.

```ruby
font = Font.new("./assets/my_font.ttf", size: 16)

p font.to_h
# => {
#      :size=>16,
#      :glyph_count=>95,
#      :glyph_padding=>4,
#      :texture=>{
#        :id=>3.0,
#        :width=>512.0,
#        :height=>512.0,
#        :mipmaps=>1.0,
#        :format=>2.0
#      }
#    }
```

### Font#draw
When drawing a font to the screen, you now no longer need to specify a {Vector2}
yourself, you can just pass `x` and `y` like this.
```ruby
font.draw("hello", x: 16, y: 42)
```

But passing `position` is still supported, so this still works.
```ruby
font.draw("hello", position: Vector2.new(16, 42))
```

### Font#to_image
The `padding` argument is now `spacing` to be more consistent and more
accurately represent what it does.
```ruby
font.to_image("hello", padding: 3)
```

becomes
```ruby
font.to_image("hello", spacing: 3)
```
